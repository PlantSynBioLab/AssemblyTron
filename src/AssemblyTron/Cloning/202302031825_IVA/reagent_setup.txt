NOTE: if a template is listed twice, (ie, pwl106 in B6 and C3) then skip the second position, and move remaining templates up a slot 
This is ok because this setup sheet and df object in the script are both set up from pcr.csv, except df just takes out repeasts.  
Put pWL274_TIR1Biosensor in deckslot4 C1
Put pWL273 in deckslot4 C2
