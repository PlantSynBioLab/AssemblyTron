DNA-Assembly line implements combinatorial DNA assemblies based on designs created with j5 (Hillson, N.J., Rosengarten, R.D., and Keasling J.D. (2012) j5 DNA Assembly Design Automation Software. ACS Synthetic Biology 1 (1), 14-21. DOI: 10.1021/sb2000116), currently accessibe via: https://public-diva.jbei.org/. \nThe AssemblyTron vignette is hosted at: https://plantsynbiolab.github.io/AssemblyTron-vignette/ and is intended to guide a novice user through installation and use of AssemblyTron to build DNA constructs via Golden Gate assembly in the Opentrons OT-2 robot. We assume that the user has a folder/directory containing the results of a j5 combinatorial assembly design on the computer connected to their OT-2 robot. AssemblyTron then operates on the files within this folder to generate specific assembly instructions for the user and the OT-2 robot which are saved in this folder. The vignette is also available on our Github. \nTechnical documentation is stored on our Github and hosted at: https://assemblytron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/AssemblyTron.html",
