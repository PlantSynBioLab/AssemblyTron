AssemblyTron is a package for automating DNA assembly with an Opentrons liquid handling robot. AssemblyTron implements combinatorial DNA assemblies based on designs created with j5 (Hillson, N.J., Rosengarten, R.D., and Keasling J.D. (2012) j5 DNA Assembly Design Automation Software. ACS Synthetic Biology 1 (1), 14-21. DOI: 10.1021/sb2000116), currently accessibe via: https://public-diva.jbei.org/.  

The AssemblyTron vignette is hosted at: https://plantsynbiolab.github.io/AssemblyTron-vignette/ and is intended to guide a novice user through installation and use of AssemblyTron to build DNA constructs via Golden Gate assembly in the Opentrons OT-2 robot. You can also view an Opentrons webinar on AssemblyTron here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48J2LacyGeA. We assume that the user has a folder/directory containing the results of a j5 combinatorial assembly design on the computer connected to their OT-2 robot. AssemblyTron then operates on the files within this folder to generate specific assembly instructions for the user and the OT-2 robot which are saved in this folder. The vignette is also available on our Github.  

Technical documentation is stored on our Github and hosted at: https://assemblytron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/AssemblyTron.html
